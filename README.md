Job Market Intelligence Dashboard – Data Analytics Roles

📌 Project Overview



This project analyzes large-scale job posting data to uncover job demand trends, salary benchmarks, and work mode patterns for data analytics roles.

The aim is to turn raw job listings into clear, actionable insights that can support job seekers, recruiters, and hiring decisions.



The project represents an end-to-end data analytics workflow, combining data cleaning, structured querying, and interactive dashboard development to reflect real-world analytics practices.



💭 Why This Project?



I built this project to better understand how the data analytics job market is structured and how insights can be extracted from imperfect, real-world datasets.

It also helped me strengthen my skills in working across the full analytics pipeline—from raw data to insight-driven storytelling.



🎯 Objectives



Identify the most in-demand roles in data analytics



Analyze salary trends across different locations



Understand patterns in remote, onsite, and hybrid work modes



Highlight common data quality challenges found in job postings



🧰 Tools \& Technologies



SQL (SQLite) – Data storage, querying, and aggregation



Python (pandas) – Data cleaning and preprocessing



Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data visualization



GitHub – Version control and project documentation

🔄 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)



Cleaned and standardized raw job posting data



Addressed missing values and inconsistent labels (e.g., work mode classifications)



Prepared structured datasets suitable for SQL analysis and visualization



2️⃣ Data Storage \& Analysis (SQLite + SQL)



Stored cleaned data in a SQLite database



Wrote structured SQL queries using:



Aggregations



CASE WHEN logic



Grouping and filtering



Analyzed job demand, salary patterns, and posting activity



3️⃣ Visualization \& Storytelling (Power BI)



Designed a multi-page interactive dashboard



Added slicers for role, location, and work mode to support exploration



Enabled drill-through for role-level analysis



Focused on clarity, usability, and insight-driven visuals



📊 Key Insights



Data Analyst roles account for the highest demand, with visible progression into senior and specialized positions



Salary levels vary significantly by location, with higher averages in major tech regions



Many job postings contain unspecified work mode information, reflecting real-world data inconsistencies



Remote opportunities represent a substantial portion of the job market



Entry-level roles show the strongest demand, indicating opportunities for early-career candidates
